            Welcome to my portal page! I created this page as an assignment for 
            for my Web Fundementals class at BYU Idaho. I disigned and put together this website 
            from start to finish using the knowlage gained from the first half of the semester in this class. 
            This isn't the first website I've designed though. My first website is a previuse portal
            page that I made while following along with my professer as he demenstrated the skills
            we would learn in this class by creating his own portal page as an example. The site is 
            not complete and was only used to get a basic understand of HTML and CSS but it still has
            some functionality. Here's the link!

            This page has links to four pages I've made, three of which are in the navigation bar.
            Each one of them were designed by me in one way or another. I've had a fun time figuring 
            out how to solve problems with HTML and CSS and each project I learn something new that 
            I can apply to my next page. I made a table down below displaying information about each one. 
            There is also a form on the left side of the screen that you can fill out about what your 
            favorite page is and why.

            For my final project in this class I had to create a report as we took roles as a client, Lead Developer,
            and Jr. Developers. Each role had a section in the report detailing what that role entailed and my experience
            with it. Here is the link to that report.
