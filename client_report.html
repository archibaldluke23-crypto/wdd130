        How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?

        How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?
        
        Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?
        
        What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?
        -->
        <p>
    I decided to base the content on my own understanding of animation instead of researching what 
    professionals do because I wanted this site to be friendly to beginners. I chose the pictures 
    by considering whether they looked appealing and if they fit the topic of the section they were in. I also used some 
    shots from my own animations to show off my work. I communicated with my developer through email. 
    There were no issues with communication. They almost met my expectations for the site. Some things I didn't like were the 
    footer layout, some items being misaligned, and some of the word colors they chose, which made it hard to read. Next time I hire a team to do a project for me, 
    I will let them know what colors I want them to use for the text.

<h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>

<p>
    We communicated on Teams and made sure to let them know what their tasks were as soon as possible so they could work 
    on their pages right away. I checked in on the progress they were making regularly to make sure they were on track. 
    I communicated with my client through email. There was an issue where the system thought his attachment was malicious, but 
    I figured it out. I sat right next to him in class, so I just showed him on my laptop every week. I also emailed him the 
    link after a while so he could see it on his own device. My experience managing the site with GitHub was good, but I 
    got confused a couple of times about pulling and pushing changes because sometimes I would forget to pull before making updates.

<h2>Jr. Developer Report 1</h2>

<p>
    I communicated with my team leads through text and email. There was a communication error with one of my team leads 
    when she forgot to tell me that I was in charge of making two pages instead of one, but that was after our first email 
    where she listed our roles, so it was partly my fault. On the other team there were no issues. For the first site I was confused 
    about a lot of things in terms of content and images because they only gave us a rough outline of what they wanted, and I had to figure out the rest on my own, 
    including what movies, TV shows, and games to write descriptions of as well as find a picture for each one. For the 
    second site I had a better idea of what was expected of me because they gave me a more detailed outline with all the 
    content and images I needed. I was able to contribute quite a bit to both sites, including the HTML structure, CSS styling, and content. 
    I had an issue where the changes I made didn't show up on the site after pushing them to GitHub, even though the Actions 
    tab said it was successful. I just had to wait a while for it to fully update.

<h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>

<p id="bottom">
    The most challenging part of this project for me was relying on other people to respond or get in contact with the client 
    so I could start working on my part of the project. I was able to overcome it by sending reminders and checking in with them regularly. 
    I loved jumping between working on different websites and seeing the different styles and designs each team came up with. 
    If I could do the project again, I would make sure to get in contact with my team leads and client right away so I could start working sooner. 
    I would also clarify what my role was and what was expected of me immediately so I wouldn't have any confusion or 
    unnecessary stress later on. I feel a lot more confident working on real-world projects after this experience 
    because I now have a better understanding of how to get input from a client and how to manage my time and tasks.
